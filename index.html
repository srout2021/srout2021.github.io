	<h1>IEEE Website</h1>
	<!-- Created an img element to store an image on the website (Part 8) -->
	<img src="IEEEPicture.jpg" alt = "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Logo">
	<!-- Created first class called section-1 that has multiple elements and styled the group (Part 2) -->
	<!-- Also used div to divide this group of elements from the second group of elements (Part 4) -->
	<div class="section-1">
	<h2>IEEE Computational Intelligence Society</h2>
	<p>CIS is a network of pioneers interested in nature inspired problem-solving including neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, fuzzy systems, and hybrid intelligent systems. CIS researchers, professionals, and practitioners provide insight into the development of Big Data and the Internet of Things. Membership includes access to periodicals, conference discounts, and more.</p>
	<h2>IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</h2>
	<p>EMBS is the world's largest international society of biomedical engineers who design the electrical circuits that make a pacemaker run, create the software that reads an MRI, and help develop the wireless technologies that allow patients and doctors to communicate over long distances. Membership includes access to multiple periodicals, conference discounts, and networking opportunities.</p>

	<!-- Created second class called section-2 that has multiple elements and styled the group (Part 2) -->
	<!-- Also used div to divide this group of elements from the first group of elements (Part 4) -->
	<div class="section-2">
	<h2>IEEE Power Electronics Society</h2>
	<p>PELS members focus on the effective use of electronic components, the application of circuit theory and design techniques, and the development of analytical tools toward efficient conversion, control and condition of electric power. Membership includes access to periodicals, discounts on conferences and workshops, and networking opportunities.</p>
	<h2>IEEE Robotics and Automation Society</h2>
	<p>RAS members foster the development and facilitate the exchange of scientific and technological knowledge in robotics and automation that benefits the profession and humanity. Membership includes access to cutting-edge periodicals, the RAS Resource Center, discounts on conferences and events, and networking opportunities.</p>
	<h2>Paragraph 5</h2>
	<!-- Created an id called conclusion for this specific paragraph element and applied a unique style (Part 3) -->
	<p id = "conclusion">As the world's largest technical professional organization, IEEE offers a number of ways to get involved with technical and local communities. These communities are active participants in research and authorship, conferences, and important conversations about today's most relevant technical topics locally and globally. With 39 technical Societies, ten geographic regions that host over 10,000 local meetings annually, several affinity and special interest groups, humanitarian opportunities, and virtual communities and private groups through IEEE CollabratecÂ®, IEEE offers ample opportunity to network and grow professionally through communities.</p>
